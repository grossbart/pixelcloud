This was a proof of concept I did for iart interactive ag <http://iart.ch> in 2008. There is a lot of fun to be had with pixel images!

How to use
----------

Run the main sketch (pixelcloud.pde) with Processing <http://processing.org/>. This sketch was tested with Processing 1.1.

You can use the following actions on the sketch:

* Click anywhere -- the image will "explode"
* Press `1` -- the image will return to its original position
* Press `2` -- the image will fold itself
* Press `b` -- toggle background drawing
* Press `up/down` keys -- change number of ripples.
